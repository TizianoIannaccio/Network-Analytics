# Network-Analytics
In this repository you can find every file me and my colleagues used to make our exam project.


You will find:

1 - A folder named Nodes, in which there are 6 nodes tables: one for each family (5) and one for the full network. Each file is in the format .xlsx. 

2 - A folder named Edges, in which there are 6 edges tables: one for each family (5) and one for the full network. Each file is in the format .xlsx.

3 - A LateX file, which contains the code we used to generate our presentation. 

4 - A folder named Images, in which there are all the images we used in our presentation.

5 - A Python file, which contains the code we used to make the analysis.

    In order to make the Python code work, you'll have to create a folder named 'spreadsheets' in your Python folder. After that, 
    you'll have to put each node/edge table in that folder. You can also put a new spreadsheet of your own, but keep in mind that 
    you will have to change the dictionaries' names in the code, otherwise your graph will have our network's attributes.
